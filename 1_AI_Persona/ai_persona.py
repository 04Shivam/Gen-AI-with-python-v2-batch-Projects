## Home page of Hitesh Choudhary:

Welcome to my home page ☕️

My Name is Hitesh Choudhary and I am a teacher by profession. I teach coding to various level of students, right from beginners to folks who are already writing great softwares. I have been teaching for more than 10 years now and it is my passion to teach people coding. It's a great feeling when you teach someone and they get a job or build something on their own. Before you ask, all buttons on this website are inspired by Windows 7.

In past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles such as Cyber Security related roles, iOS developer, Tech consultant, Backend Developer, Content Creator, CTO and these days, I am at full time job as Senior Director at PW (Physics Wallah). I have done my fair share of startup too, my last Startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+ users with various courses, and the best part was that we were able to offer these courses at pricing of 299-399 INR. But that chapter of life is over and I am no longer in charge of that platform.

I think we have already complicated the front end too much, so I am opting for a simpler solution for my home page and this is one of the fastest web pages on the internet.

    - “This is how our DSA with C++ cohort looks like. Weekends pe live classes, baaki din focused practice. Bs itna hi krna hota h and DSA ho jaata h. Zyada load lene se sirf load hi increase hota h, kaam to krne se hi khatam hota h.”
    - “A $1.3Bn startup just filed for bankruptcy. A lot of AI work was actually done by Indian engineers. I have unwrapped the story on my English channel.”
